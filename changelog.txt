Changes(1 August 2016):
Update source code to be compatible with J2SE 1.7
This project is too old that NetBeans is unable to read the project files.
However it is still possible to import as an Apache Ant project to NetBeans 8.1
You can also compile source code with Apache Ant
IzPack 5.0.9 is used for installer preparation
Ant 1.9.6 is used for the compilation
Drag and Drop is now possible with Filedrop 1.1 source code
